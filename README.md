## Welcome to CodeClimbers 👋

CodeClimbers is an open-source, privacy-first tool to help developers focus and spend more time coding. 
1. Trustworthy — You can trust it, because you built it and it lives only on your machine.
2. Private by default — Data is collected locally so you're the only person who has access to it.
3. Free — CodeClimbers will be free forever for individuals.

## Our Values

- Customer obsession: We focus on solving real customer problems through constant, high-quality research and feedback.
- Craftsmanship: We love refining our craft, just like our users, and we demonstrate this by using our own tools.
- Personal touch: We value meaningful, high-quality interactions over automated processes.
- Givers, not takers: We aim to give value in every interaction in the community.
- Net positive impact: Our goal is to provide value that enhances individuals’ well-being, not just generate revenue.
