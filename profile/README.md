## Hi there 👋 We are on a mission to build tools that help digital workers get wins everyday

We want to build products that are useful to the community they are part of. CodeClimber aims to be the following:
1. Trustworthy -- You can trust it, because you built it and it lives only on your machine.
2. Private by default -- Default settings make sure that you're the only person who has access to your data.
3. Gamified -- Encourages high impact activity daily through thoughtful gamification 

## What is CodeClimber?
Digital workers like yourself crave challenges and meaningful recognition for your work. Because the work is often complex, the wins you feel on a day to day basis are limited. CodeClimber recognizes this and transforms every task tackled, every line of code written, and every innovative solution developed into an achievement. By acknowledging these daily achievements, you can gain additional motivation and convinction that you are making steps towards your goals.

CodeClimber shifts the focus from conventional, top-down tools designed primarily for managers and businesses, to an individual-centric platform. Ultimately, CodeClimber is built for individuals. This radical shift puts the power of validation in the hands of those who create and contribute, enhancing autonomy and trust.

With CodeClimber, each digital worker is a significant player in their narrative to create the world they believe in
