## Welcome to CodeClimbers üëã

CodeClimbers is a community of developers developing open-source software for OS tracking and monitoring.

## Our Values

- We are obsessive about hearing and solving problems
- We personally use our products and practice what we preach
- Do things that don‚Äôt scale: automation should be avoided where possible, especially when it comes to interactions with others
- We strive to be ‚Äúgivers‚Äù in our relationships
- We believe in being a net positive to the communities we serve. Revenue is a measure of value created but in the case of tracking tools can often lead to sacrificing individuals‚Äô well-being for the benefit of a business. As we pursue revenue, we are committed to giving value to individuals instead of extracting value from them.
